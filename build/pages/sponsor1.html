    <p>PetFirst Pet Insurance</p>
    <div>PetFirst Pet Insurance is our main sponsor for this event. They have been providing excellent pet insurance in the United States for over a decade.</div>
    <div>From their about us page : "After our co-founder, Brent, had to put his dog Midnight down in 2003, he knew he wanted to find a way to help pet parents 
        take financial considerations out of the conversations about veterinary care. Together with his friend and colleague Lansdon, he started PetFirst the next 
        year in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
        
        When we started  in 2004 with just two employees, we had no idea what we’d grow into. Today, PetFirst is one of the fastest-growing pet health insurance 
        companies in North America, and we’ve helped thousands of families pay for their pets’ veterinary care. We recently relocated to a larger headquarters to 
        expand with our growth. 
        
        We come to work every day excited to create compelling, helpful pet insurance products and services that offer a solution for every family. We try hard to
        bring you the best policies on the market and to include you in the conversation about your pet’s care. It’s our mission to imbue our product with financial
        and emotional value for every customer, associate, and partner. We think big and dream bigger, but our number one priority is doing right by you and your pet."</div>
